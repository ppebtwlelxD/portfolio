            I am a German citizen that has lived in Norway for most of my life.
            This is the reason for me speaking and writing Norwegian, English,
            and German at a fluent level. In my spare time, I would like to say
            I am an active person that likes to work out, play games, and keep
            myself occupied with smaller projects.

            Already in middle school, I discovered my interests in design and
            web development. That is why I choose media and communication in my
            high school years. Here I started to learn the basics of media
            creation and some more complex topics like the composition of visual
            media.

            I have solid knowledge of the fundamental building blocks of the web
            including HTML, CSS, and javascript. In addition to that, I am
            experienced in working with programs like Figma, InDesign,
            Photoshop, and most other programs from the Adobe package.
          </p>

            The Web development bachelor I have from NTNU(Norwegian University
            of Science and Technology) was mostly focused on Interaction design,
            with courses like Web Design, Color in Interface Design, and Design
            Methods and Usability. There was also a large focus on working with
            user testing in both qualitative and quantitative methods.
